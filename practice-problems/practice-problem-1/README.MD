## Problem

You are working on a project that requires you to run a web application written in Python on your local machine. You have installed the necessary dependencies and packages, but when you try to run the application, you get an error saying that a particular module is missing.

Upon further investigation, you realize that the module is only available on a specific version of Python, which is different from the version that you have installed on your machine. You don't want to install a new version of Python on your machine because it could potentially cause conflicts with other programs that are using a different version.

To resolve this issue, you decide to use Docker to create a container with the specific version of Python that the module is compatible with. You will then run the web application inside the container, which will allow you to use the module without affecting the rest of your machine.

**To solve this problem, you will need to do the following**:

1. Install Docker on your machine if it is not already installed.
1. Create a Dockerfile that specifies the specific version of Python that you need, as well as any other dependencies or packages that are required for your application.
1. Build a Docker image using the Dockerfile.
1. Run a Docker container using the image, and mount your application code inside the container.
1. Test your application to make sure it is running correctly inside the container.
