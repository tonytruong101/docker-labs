## Overview

Hello! Welcome to my repo on Docker Practice Problems. This will be a place for me to create and come up with different problemsets that you must solve using Docker. This is meant to give you a similar experience to some of the day to day issues you may face working within a devops capacity.

## Quick-Start

Each practice problem will come with a scenario and an error that you will need to diagnose and resolve. The solutions to each problem will be in the solutions directory but I challenge you to resolve these problems on your own as there is no merit in just copying the answer.

To start, simply git clone this repo, go into the practice problem you wish to start and run a `docker-compose up -d` you should see the error that is in the problem displaying on your local.If not, try running a `docker-compose <container_name> logs` to see if the error is captured through the logs

To resolve, you must be able to achieve a successful `docker-compose up -d` and be able to visit the application locally to the ports it's bound too in your web browser.
