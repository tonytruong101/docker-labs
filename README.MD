## Overview

Hello! Welcome to my repo on Docker Practice Problems. This will be a place for me to create and come up with different problemsets that you must solve using Docker. This is meant to give you a hands-on experience thinking about different ways Docker could be used in many different applications.

## Quick-Start

Each practice problem will come with a scenario accompanied by an error or a project that requires you to create basic functions to interact with different containers. The problems are not organied by difficulty so I do suggest you browse through all of them, picking the ones that seems simplest to you.

All problems will have a list of challenges for you to complete.

Good luck!
